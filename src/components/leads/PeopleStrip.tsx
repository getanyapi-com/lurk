 * Every person this project has a lead on, laid along the window they posted
 * in. Only leads: a face here is someone worth answering.
 *
 * The whole window is drawn at once, columns sized off the card's width, so
 * there is nothing to scroll sideways for. What it was before was a row of
 * days that ran off the edge, and a month of leads meant the newest three days
 * on screen and the rest of the shape of the month behind a scrollbar.
 *
 * Every column is a link to the slice it draws - a month, a day, an hour -
 * and the column says so before it is clicked: hovering lights the whole of it
 * and names what clicking would do. The one already picked stays lit, and
 * clicking it again is how it is given back.
 *
 * The faces are the people's own Reddit pictures and nothing else. The Reddit
 * mark a row wears on its corner is not here: every face in the strip is from
 * Reddit, so sixty copies of the same mark said nothing and covered a sixth of
 * each picture at the size these are drawn.
