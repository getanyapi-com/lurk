/**
 * The model's two answers about this person, as one chip.
 *
 * It used to be the folded score as a percent, and the fold is not a percent of
 * anything: a fifth of it is a freshness clock, so a thread the product fully
 * fits where someone is explicitly asking reads 70 once it is three days old.
 * The number is still the feed's sort order; it is no longer a claim shown to a
 * person. The colour keeps its old meaning and hangs on intent, which is what
 * "hot" was ever about: an explicit near-term decision is hot, an explicit ask
 * is warm, everything else is cool.
 *
 * Then it was two words split by a slash - "Fits fully / Asking" - which reads
 * as one broken phrase, and neither half said what it was about. The two
 * answers are not alike and are no longer drawn alike: where this person is is
 * the sentence, because it is what you act on and when; whether your product is
 * what they need is the four dots beside it, because on a feed it is a
 * comparison between rows rather than a thing you read. One line, one chip.
